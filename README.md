template
========

This is my template project. Lately, most of my C projects look the same. So,
to save me from some serious work (setting up XCode projects is a nightmare)
I made this little template and supplied a script to do all the neccessary
substitutions.

Usage
-----

### Initial setup:

Just clone the template project and call the `subst.sh` script. The script
takes a single parameter: The name for your new project. It uses `git config`
to determine your name and email, and inserts the current year into all license
templates (which are BSD, by the way).

    git clone git@github.com:jpommerening/template.git myproject
    cd myproject
    ./subst.sh myproject
    git commit

### Pulling updates:

After doint it's substitutions and renaming, the script commits all modified files
and renames `origin` to `template`.

So, assuming youÂ´re on the `master` branch, if you want to pull updates (in many
cases this might actually work, because `git` is awesome) just use the following
command:

    git pull template master
